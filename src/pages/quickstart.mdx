# Quickstart

Creating a bot is as simple as running the following command and following the instructions
<Note>
  Prerequisites to consider before using this tool, [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) v20 or higher and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
</Note>


<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm create bot-whatsapp@latest
```

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm create bot-whatsapp@latest
```
</CodeGroup>

Use the space key to select and the enter key to confirm. 

The CLI performs a preliminary check of the Node and operating system version, informing you if it meets the requirements or providing you with relevant information. In addition to generating a base project for you to simply start up


## Requirements

Make sure you have installed Node version 20 or higher, below you can see an example to check the version of node you are using.

```bash
node -v
v20.10.0
```

<div className="not-prose aling-block">
  <Button
    href="https://nodejs.org/en"
    variant="text"
    target="_blank"
    arrow="right"
    children="Download node from its official website"
  />
</div>

It is recommended to have GIT installed for proper operation. If you are using Linux or MacOc you probably already have GIT installed by default.

```bash
git -v
git version XXXX
```

<div className="not-prose aling-block">
  <Button
    href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"
    variant="text"
    target="_blank"
    arrow="right"
    children="Download GIT from its official website"
  />
</div>
