# Practices

The library is based on three key components for its correct functioning: the Flow, in charge of building the context of the conversation and offering a friendly interface to the developer; the Provider, which acts as a connector allowing to easily switch between WhatsApp providers without the risk of affecting other parts of the bot; and the Database, which in line with this connector philosophy, facilitates changing the data persistence layer without the need to rewrite the workflow.

## Conversational history {{ tag: 'state'  }}

Often, we will need to manage conversations and keep the context in a memory called `state` which is volatile and accessible from any function executed in a stream.

<CodeGroup>
```ts 
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(['hello'])
      .addAnswer(
          "¬øWhat's your name?",
          {capture: true},
          async (ctx, { flowDynamic, state }) => {
              await state.update({ name: ctx.body })
              await flowDynamic('Thanks for giving me your name!')
          }
      )
      .addAnswer(
          '¬øHow old are you?',
           {capture: true},
          async (ctx, { flowDynamic, state }) => {
              const name = state.get('name')
              await state.update({ age: ctx.body })
              await flowDynamic(`Thanks for sharing your age! ${name}`)
          }
      )
      .addAnswer('Here is your data:', null, async (_, { flowDynamic, state }) => {
          const myState = state.getMyState()
          await flowDynamic(`Name: ${myState.name} Age: ${myState.age}`)
      })
```
</CodeGroup>

## Dynamic Messages {{ tag: 'flowDynamic'  }}

In other occasions we need to send messages in a dynamic way of data that can be variable, below you can see an example of how you should do it and how you should NOT do it.

<Error>
 ‚ùå Avoid it this, does not work because addAnswer serializes the content at the start of execution.
</Error>

```ts
let name = ''

const flow = addKeyword('hello')
    .addAnswer(`What is your name?`, { capture: true }, async (ctx) => {
        name = ctx.body
    })
    .addAnswer(`Your name is: ${name}`)
```
<Note>
If you want to send a dynamic message use flowDynamic.
</Note>

```ts
const flow = addKeyword('hello')
    .addAnswer(`What is your name?`, { capture: true }, async (ctx, { state }) => {
        await state.update({ name: ctx.body })
    })
    .addAction(async (ctx, { state, flowDynamic }) => {
        const name = state.get('name')
        await flowDynamic(`Your name is: ${name}`)
    })
```

---

## Send File

When you want to send an image, audio, file or any other file you can do it in this way

```ts
const flow = addKeyword('hello')
    .addAnswer(`Send image from URL`, 
        { media: 'https://i.imgur.com/0HpzsEm.png' }
    )
    .addAnswer(`Send video from URL`, 
        { media: 'https://media.giphy.com/media/KWZKwdBC2ODWlQ8kgt/giphy.mp4' }
    )
    .addAnswer(`Send file from URL`, 
        { media: 'https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf' }
    )
```

Other ways to use when the route is coming from a dynamic data source

```ts
const flow = addKeyword('hello')
    .addAction(async (_,{flowDynamic}) => {
        // ...db get source...
        await flowDynamic([
            {body:'This is an image', media:'https://i.imgur.com/0HpzsEm.png'}
        ])
        await flowDynamic([
            {body:'This is a video', media:'https://media.giphy.com/media/KWZKwdBC2ODWlQ8kgt/giphy.mp4'}
        ])
    })

```

## Switch to another flow {{ tag: 'gotoFlow'  }}

If you want to divert a conversational flow to another logic flow based on a response input you can do it in this way:

```ts

const flowToA = addKeyword(EVENTS.ACTION).addAnswer('Here we have Option A!')
const flowToB = addKeyword(EVENTS.ACTION).addAnswer('Here we have Option B!')
const flowToC = addKeyword(EVENTS.ACTION).addAnswer('Here we have Option C!')

const flowDefault = addKeyword(EVENTS.ACTION).addAnswer("We don't have that Option ü§î")

const flow = addKeyword('order')
    .addAnswer(
        [
            `Which one is the best option for you?`,
            `Type **A**`,
            `Type **B**`,
            `Type **C**`,
        ], 
        { capture: true }
    )
    .addAnswer(`Thanks for you answer`,async (ctx, {gotoFlow})=> {
        const userAnswer = ctx.body
        if(userAnswer === 'A'){
            return gotoFlow(flowToA)
        } 
        if(userAnswer === 'B'){
            return gotoFlow(flowToB)
        } 
        if(userAnswer === 'C'){
            return gotoFlow(flowToC)
        } 
        return gotoFlow(flowDefault)

    })
    .addAnswer(`this message will not be sent`)
```

<Error>
 ‚ùå This does not work, the invocation of the gotoFlow function must necessarily include a return.
</Error>

```ts

//...Previous code...
    ....addAnswer(`Thanks for you answer`,async (ctx, {gotoFlow})=> {
        gotoFlow(flowToA)

    })
    .addAnswer(`this message will not be sent`)
```

<Note>
 This does work
</Note>

```ts

//...Previous code...
    ....addAnswer(`Thanks for you answer`,async (ctx, {gotoFlow})=> {
        return gotoFlow(flowToA)

    })
    .addAnswer(`this message will not be sent`)
```

## How turn off bot

Sometimes we will need to turn off the bot for a certain user, so that we can have a conversation with the client without the bot interfering.

```ts
  const banListFlow = addKeyword<BaileysProvider>('magic keyword')
    .addAnswer("What's the number to ignore?", {capture:true}, async (ctx, {blacklist, flowDynamic}) => {
      const numberToBan = ctx.body
      blacklist.add(numberToBan)
      await flowDynamic(`This number ${numberToBan} is now on the black-list and can only chat with a human ü§ñ`)
    })
```
