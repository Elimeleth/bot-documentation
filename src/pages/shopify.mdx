To integrate the plugin into your other flows, you need to install the library:

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
    pnpm install @builderbot-plugins/shopify
```
```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
    npm install @builderbot-plugins/shopify
```
</CodeGroup>


```typescript
    import 'dotenv/config'
    import { createBot, MemoryDB, createProvider, createFlow } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
    import { createShopifyFlow } from '@builderbot-plugins/shopify'
    import BaileysProvider from "@bot-whatsapp/provider/baileys";

    const main = async () => {

        const provider = createProvider(BaileysProvider)

        const { flow } = await createShopifyFlow({
            modelName: 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k',
            openApiKey: "YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY_HERE",
            shopifyApiKey: "YOUR_SHOPIFY_API_KEY_HERE",
            shopifyDomain: "YOUR_SHOPIFY_DOMAIN_HERE"
        })

        await createBot({
            database: new MemoryDB(),
            provider,
            flow: createFlow(flow)
        })

    }

    main()
```

__ACCURACY FROM PLUGIN__

The plugin was subjected to various conversational tests, ranging from direct questions to more conversational ones.
![flows into a conversation](https://imgur.com/bVN4xgg.jpg)

The plugin has a 97% of preccision when the conversation is not ambiguous

The plugin has a 96% accuracy when the conversation is unambiguous. This means it is as accurate as the question itself.
This does not diminish its potential.

TODO:

- [ ] Improve history conversation.

- [ ] Manage ambiguous question in same flow.

- [ ] Improve answer triguers by agents.
