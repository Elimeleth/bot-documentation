# Practices

The library is based on three key components for its correct functioning: the Flow, in charge of building the context of the conversation and offering a friendly interface to the developer; the Provider, which acts as a connector allowing to easily switch between WhatsApp providers without the risk of affecting other parts of the bot; and the Database, which in line with this connector philosophy, facilitates changing the data persistence layer without the need to rewrite the workflow.

## State

Refers to creating structured sequences of interactions, as in building conversation flows. Two key methods are addKeyword and addAnswer, which allow keywords to be associated with specific responses, providing options for customizing the conversation flow.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
import { addKeyword } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'

addKeyword(['hello','hi']).addAnswer('Ey! welcome')
```

```js {{ title: 'app.js' }}
const { addKeyword } = require('@bot-whatsapp/bot') 

addKeyword(['hello','hi']).addAnswer('Ey! welcome')
```
</CodeGroup>



Some examples of how to use the addKeyword in which you can place the __keyword__ or a list of __keywords__ that will be used to start a conversational flow


```ts
// Example with single keyword
addKeyword('hello').addAnswer('Ey! welcome')

// Example with multi keywords
addKeyword(['hello','hi']).addAnswer('Ey! welcome')
```
