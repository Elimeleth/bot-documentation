# Context

The library is based on three key components for its correct functioning: the Flow, in charge of building the context of the conversation and offering a friendly interface to the developer; the Provider, which acts as a connector allowing to easily switch between WhatsApp providers without the risk of affecting other parts of the bot; and the Database, which in line with this connector philosophy, facilitates changing the data persistence layer without the need to rewrite the workflow.
