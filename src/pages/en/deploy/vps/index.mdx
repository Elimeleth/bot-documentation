# VPS (Virtual Private Server)


Previously, you need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your server depending on the operating system, the processes change, you can find all the official information about docker at this link.

Depending on the provider you have chosen, you will need a specific Docker implementation, but don't worry, as it comes automatically implemented in a file called Dockerfile, you can also view the other Dockerfiles in the templates section.

<Note>
Dockerfile, [Build Image](docker#build-image), [Run Container](docker#run-container), [Portainer](docker#portainer)
</Note>

```bash
ssh root@66.97.47.153 -p5088
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```


First you must download the [NodeJS installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) depending on your operating system but this guide focuses on Ubuntu 22.
It is important to run the following commands in order for the changes to take effect

```bash {{title:' Install NVM (Node Version Manager)'}}
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

```bash {{title:' Set NVM environment variables'}}
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

```bash {{title:' Install Node.js version 20'}}
nvm install 20
```

Now you have node installed on your server ready to use, the following steps will be performed inside the directory of your project you are working on.

We will proceed to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) the node package manager that we use and we will also install [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) that daemon which helps us to keep node applications running in the background.



```bash {{title:' Install pnpm and pm2'}}
npm i pnpm@latest pm2 --global
```
Now we proceed to clone the builderbot-examples project and install the dependencies necessary for its operation.

<Warning>
Remember to release the corresponding ports in your server's firewall. Example 3008
</Warning>

```bash {{title:' Clone Project'}}
git clone https://github.com/codigoencasa/builderbot-examples-bot.git
cd builderbot-examples-bot
```
```bash {{title:' Install', label:'/root/builderbot-examples-bot'}}
pnpm install
```
Como es un proyecto en TypeScript necesitamos hacer el paso previo de la compilaciones y posteriormente iniciamos nuestro proyecto con pm2 ademas si quieres ver los logs puedes usar el comando `pm2 logs`

```bash {{title:' Build',  label:'/root/builderbot-examples-bot'}}
pnpm run build
pm2 start ./dist/app.js --name bot
pm2 logs
```

``` {{title:' Terminal'}}

âš¡âš¡ ACTION REQUIRED âš¡âš¡
You must scan the QR Code
Remember that the QR code updates every minute
Need help: https://link.codigoencasa.com/DISCORD
```

As we can see the project is running and ready to scan the QR code, now only remains to link your whatsapp for that step visit `http://your-ip-public:3008`.
<Warning>
Remember this QR code is updated every 45 seconds approximately, if you have a linking error refresh the F5 page.
