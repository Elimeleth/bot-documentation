# Deploying

Congratulations the time has come to take your project to production and for your convenience there are several ways to achieve this from quite tenic options to other easier strategies.

It should be noted that for the application to function correctly, the execution must be kept alive, which means that a server running the application code must be maintained.
Therefore, __it is not recommended to use serverless__  services.

<Note>
Deployment methods: [Railway](/deploy/railway), [Docker](/deploy/docker), [VPS](/deploy/vps)
</Note>

## Railway {{tag:'Easy'}}

[Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=jyd_0y) provides infrastructure primitives with sane defaults to manage secrets, builds, and deploys. So you can start quickly and focus on your product.

Using this service, you won't have to worry about anything as it is capable of automatically reading the different packages necessary for your application to function correctly, in addition to providing you with a subdomain with HTTPS security.

## Docker {{tag:'Medium'}}

[Dockerizing](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) the application is the best option if you are looking for a more personalized and scalable solution. It is also important to note that today most cloud providers support Docker containers and offer automated deployment processes.
Bot templates come with a default `Dockerfile` for basic operation. Keep in mind that depending on other libraries you use, this file may need to be adapted for proper functioning.
