Providers are in charge of providing the communication bridge between your bot and __whatsapp__, __telegram__ or custom provider.

You can change your provider very easily without affecting the logic of your bot. 
It is as simple as implementing the connector of the provider of your choice. At the moment we have integrations with more than four suppliers.

</Warning>


Each provider may need to adjust access keys, settings, among other properties that are usually passed as an object in the `createProvider` function.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'meta-provider.ts' }}
import { createProvider } from "@builderbot/bot";
import { MetaProvider } from '@builderbot/provider-meta';

export type IProvider = typeof MetaProvider
export const adapterProvider = createProvider(MetaProvider, {
    jwtToken: 'jwtToken',
    numberId: 'numberId',
    verifyToken: 'verifyToken',
    version: 'v16.0',
})
```

```ts {{ title: 'twilio-provider.ts' }}
import { createProvider } from "@builderbot/bot";
import { TwilioProvider } from '@builderbot/provider-twilio';

export type IProvider = typeof TwilioProvider
export const adapterProvider = createProvider(TwilioProvider, {
    accountSid: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID',
    authToken: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_TOKEN',
    vendorNumber: '+14155238886',
    publicUrl: "public_url", //optional
});
```

```ts {{ title: 'baileys-provider.ts' }}
import { createProvider } from "@builderbot/bot";
import { BaileysProvider } from '@builderbot/provider-baileys';

export type IProvider = typeof BaileysProvider
export const adapterProvider = createProvider(BaileysProvider)
```

```ts {{ title: 'venom-provider.ts' }}
import { createProvider } from "@builderbot/bot";
import { VenomProvider } from '@builderbot/provider-venom';

export type IProvider = typeof VenomProvider
export const adapterProvider = createProvider(VenomProvider)
```

```ts {{ title: 'wppconnect-provider.ts' }}
import { createProvider } from "@builderbot/bot";
import { WPPConnectProvider } from '@builderbot/provider-wppconnect';

export type IProvider = typeof WPPConnectProvider
export const adapterProvider = createProvider(WPPConnectProvider)
```

</CodeGroup>

Below you will find more information about each of these providers.
