# Chatbot with Context

The gemini model is a generous and valuable resource to use if it comes to creating a product with AI that has both vision and text generation and without spending a penny is what we want.

To start remember to install the gemini plugin and have your [Google Api key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## Implement a flow context

`pnpm install "@builderbot-plugins/gemini-layer`

Sometimes we don't want to place so many keywords or answers in validations of our flows, we want some freedom when it comes to responding, that's why we have the gemini plugin to respond based on a context


the context indicates between key value, the different scenarios in which the user may be when interacting with the assistant

`context`: YOUR CONTEXT OBJECT

```ts {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
import { createbot, createProvider, createFlow, MemoryDB } from '@builderbot/bot'
import { BaileysProvider } from '@builderbot/provider-baileys'

import contextFlow from "./flows/context.flow"

/* SOME STUFF IMPORTS */

await createbot({
    database: new MemoryDB(),
    provider: createProvider(BaileysProvider),
    flow: createFlow([...othersFlows, contextFlow])
})

```
```ts {{ title: 'flows/context.flow.ts' }}

import { EVENTS, addKeyword } from "@builderbot/bot"
import contextLayer from "./layers/context.layer"

export default addKeyword(EVENTS.ACTION)
    .addAction(contextLayer)

```


```ts {{ title: 'layers/context.layer.ts' }}

import { geminiLayer } from "@builderbot-plugins/gemini-layer"
import { EVENTS, addKeyword } from "@builderbot/bot"


export default async (...bot: any) => await geminiLayer({
        context: {
            name: 'your name',
            email: 'your email',
            summary: 'your summary'
            // and more properties
        }
    }, bot)
