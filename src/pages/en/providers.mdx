# Providers

## Meta

The WhatsApp Business Platform enables medium and large businesses to communicate with their customers on a large scale. You can initiate conversations with customers in just minutes, send them customer service notifications or purchase updates, offer them a personalized level of service, and provide support through the channel of their choice.

<Warning>
Remember that the following requirements must be met in order to implement the meta provider to production. [More information](/providers/meta)
</Warning>


```ts {{ title: 'main-meta-provider.ts' }}
import { createBot, createProvider, createFlow, addKeyword, MemoryDB } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
import { MetaProvider } from '@bot-whatsapp/provider-meta';

const welcomeFlow = addKeyword<MetaProvider, MemoryDB>(['hello', 'hi']).addAnswer('Ey! welcome')

const main = async () => {

    const adapterDB = new MemoryDB()
    const adapterFlow = createFlow([welcomeFlow])

    const adapterProvider = createProvider(MetaProvider, {
        jwtToken: 'jwtToken',
        numberId: 'numberId',
        verifyToken: 'verifyToken',
        version: 'v16.0',
    })

    await createBot({
        flow: adapterFlow,
        provider: adapterProvider,
        database: adapterDB,
    })
}

main()
```

## Twilio

The library is based on three key components for its correct functioning: the Flow, in charge of building the context of the conversation and offering a friendly interface to the developer; the Provider, which acts as a connector allowing to easily switch between WhatsApp providers without the risk of affecting other parts of the bot; and the Database, which in line with this connector philosophy, facilitates changing the data persistence layer without the need to rewrite the workflow.
