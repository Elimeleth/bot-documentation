# Forward conversation to human
## Issue {{not:'true'}}
I need to be able to stop the bot to continue the conversation with one person but still allow other people to see it.

## Possible Solution {{not:'true'}}

In this example let's imagine that the bot number is `ADMIN_NUMBER` the idea is that if a user writes me the bot will answer this is correct, but 
I want to pause the bot for that user, what I do is write to my own number from the whatsapp with a phrase `Mute +34000000` assuming that the number 
of the user I want to pause is `+34000000` and the logic I perform is to clean characters to only get 
`34000000` and check if it exists in a __blackList__ if it is not found I add it in this way the bot stops responding to that
 user and I can continue talking to the person and when I want to reactivate the bot for this person I write again `Mute +34000000`
 and if it is found it removes it from the blacklist is basically a switch.

import { createBot, createProvider, createFlow, addKeyword, utils } from '@builderbot/bot'
import { MemoryDB as Database } from '@builderbot/bot'
import { BaileysProvider as Provider } from '@builderbot/provider-baileys'
import { numberClean } from './utils'

const PORT = process.env.PORT ?? 3008
const ADMIN_NUMBER = process.env.ADMIN_NUMBER 

const blackListFlow = addKeyword<Provider, Database>('mute')
    .addAction(async (ctx, { blacklist, flowDynamic }) => {
        if (ctx.from === ADMIN_NUMBER) {
            const toMute = numberClean(ctx.body) //Mute +34000000 message incoming
            const check = blacklist.checkIf(toMute)
            if (!check) {
                blacklist.add(toMute)

    httpServer(+PORT)
}

main()
```
```ts {{title:'util.ts'}}
export const numberClean = (raw: string): string => {
    //Mute +3400000 
    const number = raw.toLowerCase().replace('mute', '').replace(/\s/g, '').replace('+', '')
    // 3400000
    return number
}
