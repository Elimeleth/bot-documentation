# Queue Limit

## Issue {{not:'true'}}
The problem was that when more than 60 people started a conversation in less than 20 seconds the bot did not respond to all the people.

## Possible Solution {{not:'true'}}

The framework by default implements a queue manager based on per-user work promises.
If you already understand the concept and you are in an environment where you receive a considerable number of recurring messages in a short period of time and you notice that it answers a large number of users but not all of them. You can try extending the process queue configuration.

__Imagine the case__ in which you receive more than 60 messages from more than 60 people in a very short period of time of less than 20 seconds for example

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
    n(User n) -.-> B((Bot))
```
It is very likely that it will not respond to all users, since the default configuration of the bot is set to handle a smaller amount of processes, but it is very easy to modify.

```bash {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
const main = async () => {

    await createBot({
        database: new MemoryDB(),
        provider: createProvider(BaileysProvider),
        flow: createFlow([...])
    }, {
        queue: {
            timeout: 20000, //ðŸ‘Œ
            concurrencyLimit: 50 //ðŸ‘Œ
        }
    })
}
```
