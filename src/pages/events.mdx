## Default  {{ tag: 'WELCOME'  }}

When a user sends a "text" message that does not exist in a keyword of another flow, the WELCOME event will be triggered by default, which is the default event.
<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
  import { addKeyword, EVENTS } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.WELCOME).addAnswer('Message hello')
```
```js {{ title: 'app.js' }}
  const { addKeyword, EVENTS } = require('@bot-whatsapp/bot')
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.MEDIA).addAnswer('Message hello')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Received Image or Video {{ tag: 'MEDIA'  }}

When a user sends a "text" message that does not exist in a keyword of another flow, the WELCOME event will be triggered by default, which is the default event.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
  import { addKeyword, EVENTS } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.MEDIA).addAnswer('I received a media image/video')
```
```js {{ title: 'app.js' }}
  const { addKeyword, EVENTS } = require('@bot-whatsapp/bot')
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.MEDIA).addAnswer('I received a media image/video')
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
To save the media file you must invoke the saveFile function from the provider you are using.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
  import { addKeyword, EVENTS } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
  import { BaileysProvider } from '@bot-whatsapp/provider-baileys'

  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword<BaileysProvider>(EVENTS.MEDIA)
  .addAnswer('I received a media image/video', async (ctx, { provider }) => {
    const localPath = await provider.saveFile(ctx, {path:'...'})
    //console.log(localPath)
  })
```
```js {{ title: 'app.js' }}
  const { addKeyword, EVENTS } = require('@bot-whatsapp/bot')
  const { BaileysProvider } = require('@bot-whatsapp/bot')
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.MEDIA)
  .addAnswer('I received a media image/video', async (ctx, { provider }) => {
    const localPath = await provider.saveFile(ctx, {path:'...'})
    //console.log(localPath)
  })
```
</CodeGroup>

## Received Document {{ tag: 'DOCUMENT'  }}

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
  import { addKeyword, EVENTS } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.WELCOME).addAnswer('Message hello')
```
```js {{ title: 'app.js' }}
  const { addKeyword, EVENTS } = require('@bot-whatsapp/bot')
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.MEDIA).addAnswer('Message hello')
```
</CodeGroup>

## Received Location {{ tag: 'LOCATION'  }}

<Note>
Location must be sent via WhatsApp, does not yet allow location links from external apps
</Note>

When your chatbot needs to access a user's location, it's important to ensure that the location is sent directly from the WhatsApp app to have results. Once the location is received, you can perform a console log of ctx to view the details of the received location.

The received location context will look something like this in console:

<CodeGroup>
```js {{title: 'terminal'}}
ctx:  {
  ...
  message: Message {
    locationMessage: LocationMessage {
      degreesLatitude: -2.1462137699127197,
      degreesLongitude: -79.88981628417969,
      name: 'Doctor Miguel Angel Jij√≥n Teran',
      address: 'Doctor Miguel Angel Jij√≥n Teran, Guayaquil, Ecuador',
    },
  },
  body: '_event_location__0d5c9f57-0909-44a1-995f-902f9df3b21f',
  name: 'yeyodev üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª',
  from: '593000000000'
}

```
</CodeGroup>

This will output the user's latitude and longitude in the console, allowing you to effectively utilize the location data for your chatbot's functionality.

To access the location data, you can use the following approach:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: 'location.flow.ts' }}
import { EVENTS, addKeyword } from "@bot-whatsapp/bot";

export default addKeyword(EVENTS.LOCATION).addAnswer("I have received your location!", null, async (ctx) => {
  const userLatitude = ctx.message.locationMessage.degreesLatitude;
  const userLongitude = ctx.message.locationMessage.degreesLongitude;
})
```
```js {{ title: 'location.flow.js' }}
import { EVENTS, addKeyword } from "@bot-whatsapp/bot";

export default addKeyword(EVENTS.LOCATION).addAnswer("I have received your location!", null, async (ctx) => {
  const userLatitude = ctx.message.locationMessage.degreesLatitude;
  const userLongitude = ctx.message.locationMessage.degreesLongitude;
})
```
</CodeGroup>

  import { addKeyword, EVENTS } from '@bot-whatsapp/bot'
  
  const welcomeFlow = addKeyword(EVENTS.WELCOME).addAnswer('Message hello')
