# How to implement and manage Queue Limit


To increase the high concurrency limit in the chatbot, it will be necessary to add the queue extension to the constant that holds the extensions and then enter it into the createBot function. This configuration should be done in the main entry point file that contain "createBot"

```bash {{ title: 'app.ts' }}
const main = async () => {

    await createBot({
        database: new MemoryDB(),
        provider: createProvider(BaileysProvider),
        flow: createFlow([...])
    }, {
        queue: {
            timeout: 20000,
            concurrencyLimit: 50
        }
    })
}
```
