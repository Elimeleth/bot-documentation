# Conversations

Conversations are an essential part of Protocol — they are the containers for the messages between you, your contacts, and groups. On this page, we’ll dive into the different conversation endpoints you can use to manage conversations programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete conversations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The conversation model

The conversation model contains all the information about the conversations between you and your contacts. In addition, conversations can also be group-based with more than one contact, they can have a pinned message, and they can be muted.
